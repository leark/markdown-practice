> My favorite food happens to be a medium-rare steak.
> Here are steps on how to cook steak just like me!
> I basically do a dry brine into reverse searing the steak.

1. Buy a steak meat that's at least 1.5 inches thick.
2. Salt the steak liberally with kosher salt, or any large grain salt, and garlic powder.
3. Place the steak inside a fridge on a wirerack for at least 3 hrs.
4. Preheat oven to 200 degrees F.
5. Place the steak in the oven until inside of the steak reads 115 degrees F.
6. Get a frying pan hot with oil right before you take out the steak.
7. Sear the outside of the steak for about a minute on each side.
8. Serve right away
